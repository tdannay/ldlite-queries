--This query returns a list of books a the "MH New Books" location, sorted by receipt date and in call number order.
--Created by Tim Dannay on 2023-01-17

--I had to adjust the query to account for the 5-hour time zone difference between our time and FOLIOâ€™s GMT. 
--In the future, if FOLIO or LDLite starts to automatically adjust for the time zone difference, this query will need to be updated accordingly.
--To do this, remove "- interval '5 hours'" from the last line of the SELECT statement and the first ORDER BY statement.
